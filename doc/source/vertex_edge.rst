Vertices and Edges
===================

Vertex Types
-------------

A vertex can be of any Julia type. For example, it can be an integer, a character, or a string. In a simplistic setting where there is additional information associated with a vertex, it is recommended to use ``Int`` as the vertex type, which would lead to the best performance.

This package provides two specific vertex types: ``KeyVertex`` and ``ExVertex``. The definition of ``KeyVertex`` is:

.. code-block:: python

    immutable KeyVertex{K}
        index::Int
        key::K
    end

Here, each vertex has a unique index and a key value of a user-chosen type (*e.g.* a string).

The definition of ``ExVertex`` is:

.. code-block:: python

    type ExVertex
        index::Int
        label::UTF8String
        attributes::Dict{UTF8String,Any}  
    end

The ``ExVertex`` type allows one to attach a label as well as other attributes to a vertex. The constructor of this type takes an index and a label string as arguments. The following code shows how one can create an instance of ``ExVertex`` and attach a price to it.

.. code-block:: python

    v = ExVertex(1, "vertex-a")
    v.attributes["price"] = 100.0

The ``ExVertex`` type implements a ``vertex_index`` function, as

.. py:function:: vertex_index(v)

    returns the index of the vertex ``v``.
    
In addition, for integers, we have

.. code-block:: python

    vertex_index(v::Integer) = v
    
This makes it convenient to use integers as vertices in graphs.


Edge Types
-----------

This package provides two edge types: ``Edge`` and ``ExEdge``. The former is a basic edge type that simply encapsulates the source and target vertices of an edge, while the latter allows one to specify attributes. 

The definition of ``Edge`` is given by

.. code-block:: python

    immutable Edge{V}
        index::Int
        source::V
        target::V
    end
    
    typealias IEdge Edge{Int}

The definition of ``ExEdge`` is given by

.. code-block:: python

    type ExEdge{V}
        index::Int
        source::V
        target::V
        attributes::Dict{UTF8String,Any}
    end

``ExEdge`` has two constructors, one takes ``index``, ``source``, and ``target`` as arguments, while the other use all four fields. 
    
One can either construct an edge directly using the constructors, or use the ``add_edge`` methods for graphs, which can automatically assign an index to a new edge. 

Both edge types implement the following methods:

.. py:function:: edge_index(e)

    returns the index of the edge ``e``.

.. py:function:: source(e)

    returns the source vertex of the edge ``e``.
    
.. py:function:: target(e)

    returns the target vertex of the edge ``e``.
